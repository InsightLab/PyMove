What's PyMove?
===================

PyMove is a Python library for processing and visualization of trajectories and other spatial-temporal data.

We will also release wrappers to some useful Java libraries frequently used in the mobility domain.

Main Features

PyMove **proposes**:

- A familiar and similar syntax to Pandas;
- Clear documentation;
- Extensibility, since you can implement your main data structure by manipulating other data structures such as Dask DataFrame, numpy arrays, etc., in addition to adding new modules;
- Flexibility, as the user can switch between different data structures;
- Operations for data preprocessing, pattern mining and data visualization.
