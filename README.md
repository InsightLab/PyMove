# What is PyMove?

PyMove is a Python library to processing and visualization of trajectories and other spatial-temporal data.

We will also release wrappers to some useful Java libraries frequently used in the mobility domain.

# Main Features

PyMove **proposes**:
-  A familiar and similar syntax to Pandas;
-  Clear documentation;
-  Extensibility, since you can implement your main data structure by manipulating other data structures such as Dask DataFrame, numpy arrays, etc., in addition to adding new modules;
-  Flexibility, as the user can switch between different data structures;
-  Operations for data preprocessing, pattern mining and data visualization.
