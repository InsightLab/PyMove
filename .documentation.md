# Documentation

We use sphinx to build and readthedocs to host the documentation.

## How create doc with Sphinx
### 1. Getting to know Sphinx
#### 1.1 Sphinx
Sphinx is a documentation generator or a tool that translates a set of
plain text source files into various output formats, automatically producing
cross-references, indices, etc. That is, if you have a directory containing a
bunch of reStructuredText or Markdown documents, Sphinx can generate a series
of HTML files, a PDF file (via LaTeX), man pages and much more.

For more information access the [documentation here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).

##### 1.1.1. Sphinx APIDoc
It is a tool for automatic generation of Sphinx sources that, using the
autodoc extension, document a whole package in the style of other
automatic API documentation tools.
For more information access the [documentation here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html).

### 2. Tutorial
Here we will describe how to create a docs, configure the conf.py
file and update the documentation.

#### 2.1. Create the documentation
1.  Install Sphinx!

`pip install Sphinx`
`pip install pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`

2.  First, make the directory docs with command

`mkdir docs`

3.  Run the following command

`sphinx-apidoc -o docs pymove -full`

Finish! Your documentation has been created! The generated files are
of the extension .rst (reStructuredText).
There are **two main files**:

-   **index.rst**: is the root of your documentation

-   **conf.py**: where are the dependencies and internal settings,
 such as the html theme, and imports and the path to the library.

#### 2.2. Configure the conf.py
In the file **conf.py**, include the following imports:

`import os`

`import sys`

And include the following code snippet, referring to the library path:

`sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__name__), '..'))`

Now, you must:
1.  Describe project informations
2.  Configure extensions

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
    'sphinx.ext.coverage',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
    'sphinx_rtd_theme'
]
```

3.  Configure theme html

`html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'`

and finish!

#### 2.3. Generating the .html files
To generate the .html files, just access the docs folder, just run the
following command:

`make html`

#### 2.4. Hospedando docs in [Readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/)

1.  Log in to Readthedocs with your github account

2.  Import the project/repository

3.  Select the project and the branch where your project contains
 the documentation

4.  Click on build project

5.  After preparing the environment and finalizing the building process,
 you can see your project's documentation in **view docs**.

#### 2.5. Update the documentation
To update the documentation just run the following command and move
 the generated files to the folder `references/`.

`sphinx-apidoc -o docs pymove`
