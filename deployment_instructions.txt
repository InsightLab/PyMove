Pypi Deployment

--------

Uploading a package to PyPI


The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a package to pypi: https://dzone.com/articles/executable-package-pip-install.

---------


Get started with Travis CI:

    1. Sing up on Travis-ci with GitHub.
    2. Accept the authorization of Travis CI.
    3. Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
    4. Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.


Use the .travis.yml file to configure your deploy:
    
    1. Create an API token to authenticate with PyPI:
        1. In your Pypi count settings, go to API tokens section and select "Add API token"
        2. Set your username to __token__
    
    2. Add the following attributes to the .travis.yml file:
          "language: python
        python: "package version"
        script:
              - python setup.py sdist >/dev/null
        deploy:
          skip_existing: true
          provider: pypi
          user: "__token__"
          password:
    
          on:
                tags: true
         on:
                branch: "branch_for_deployment""

    3. Go to the folder where your .travis.yml file is and run "travis encrypt your-api-token --add deploy.password" to encrypt your password and add it to the file.

Configure versioneer:

        1. run `pip install versioneer` to somewhere to your $PATH
        2. add a `[versioneer]` section to your setup.cfg (see the header of the file versioneer.py)
        3. run `versioneer install` in your source tree, commit the results

How to deploy PyMove to Pypi using Travis CI


To deploy pymove to Pypi using you must be in the developer branch, Travis was configured to only allow deployments from the developer branch. Travis was also set to only deploy on tagged commit, the tag must start with "version-" followed by the version number of the package you want to upload. To better understand the versioner lib read the header of the file versioneer.py. 

First, commit your changes, then create a tag with the version number to be uploaded:

$ git tag version-"version number"

Push your changes and the created tag:

$ git push && git push --tags

Travis CI and the versioneer lib will do the rest for you.
