Pypi Deployment

--------

Uploading a package to PyPI


The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a package to pypi: https://dzone.com/articles/executable-package-pip-install.

---------


Get started with Travis CI:

    1. Sing up on Travis-ci with GitHub.
    2. Accept the authorization of Travis CI.
    3. Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
    4. Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.


Use the .travis.yml file to configure your deploy:
    
    1. Create an API token to authenticate with PyPI:
        1. In your Pypi count settings, go to API tokens section and select "Add API token"
        2. Set your username to __token__
    
    2. Add the following attributes to the .travis.yml file:
          "language: python
        python: "package version"
        script:
              - python setup.py sdist >/dev/null
        deploy:
          skip_existing: true
          provider: pypi
          user: "__token__"
          password:
    
          on:
                tags: true
         on:
                branch: "branch_for_deployment""

    3. Go to the folder where your .travis.yml file is and run "travis encrypt your-api-token --add deploy.password" to encrypt your password and add it to the file.

Configure versioneer:

        1. run `pip install versioneer` to somewhere to your $PATH
        2. add a `[versioneer]` section to your setup.cfg (see the header of the file versioneer.py)
        3. run `versioneer install` in your source tree, commit the results

How to deploy PyMove to Pypi using Travis CI

We are using the bumper2version lib to control the versioning.
# https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version

Run the command bumperversion [major|minor|patch] to increase the version number. This will create a new tag and commit the changes. Then push the changes to the developer branch and create a pull request.

$ git push

To deploy pymove to Pypi using you must be in the master branch, Travis was configured to only allow deployments from the master branch. Travis was also set to only deploy on tagged commit, the tag must start with "version-" followed by the version number of the package you want to upload.

Then push the new tag:

$ git push --tags

Travis CI will do the rest for you.
