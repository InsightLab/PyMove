-   [Shared Cars Locations](https://www.kaggle.com/doit-intl/autotel-shared-car-locations):
 In order to reduce the number of owned cars, the city of Tel Aviv launched a
 shared-car project, called AutoTel. Users of the service are able to reserve
 a car using a mobile app, and pay for it by the minute. The project that was
 launched in October 2017 attracted over 7500 users, with more than 50% of them
 using the service at least once a week. AutoTel can predict the geospatial
 availability of cars at given times, and use predictions to modify
 their business model. They could, for example, modify prices so that it would
 e cheaper to park cars in high demand areas, or plan the the maintenance
 program so that cars will be collected from high-supply-low-demand areas
 and returned to areas of high demand.

-   [GPS Trajectories Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/GPS+Trajectories):

 This dataset was collected from Gowalla, a popular location-based social
 network, which has more than 600,000 users since November 2010 and was
 acquired by Facebook  in December 2011. In practice, we used the
 Gowalla APIs to collect the user profiles, user friendship,
 location profiles, and users’ check-in history made  efore June 1, 2011.

 It is now integrated with the APIs of other location-based social networking
 services, e.g., Facebook Places, Foursquare, and Gowalla. Users can login
 Weeplaces using their LBSN accounts and connect with their friends in the
 same LBSN who have also used this application. All the crawled data is
 originally generated in Foursquare. This dataset contains 7,658,368 check-ins
 generated by 15,799 users over 971,309 locations. In the data collection,

 and other additional information about the locations.
