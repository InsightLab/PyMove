# Dataset Examples

- [GeoLife Trajectory Dataset - GeoLife Data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/): a GPS trajectory dataset from MicrosoftResearch GeoLife project, collected by 182 users from April 2007 to August 2012. 
- [T-Drive Taxi Trajectories: T-Drive Data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/):  sample of trajectories from MicrosoftResearch T-Drive project, generated by over 10,000 taxicabsin a week of 2008 in Beijing.
- [Crimes in Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston): This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred.  Records begin in June 14, 2015 and continue to September 3, 2018. The data is provided by Analyze Boston.
- [Shared Cars Locations](https://www.kaggle.com/doit-intl/autotel-shared-car-locations): In order to reduce the number of owned cars, the city of Tel Aviv launched a shared-car project, called AutoTel. Users of the service are able to reserve a car using a mobile app, and pay for it by the minute. The project that was launched in October 2017 attracted over 7500 users, with more than 50% of them using the service at least once a week. AutoTel can predict the geospatial availability of cars at given times, and use predictions to modify their business model. They could, for example, modify prices so that it would be cheaper to park cars in high demand areas, or plan the the maintenance program so that cars will be collected from high-supply-low-demand areas and returned to areas of high demand. 
- [GPS Trajectories Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/GPS+Trajectories): The dataset has been feed by Android app called Go!Track and is composed by two tables. The first table go_track_tracks presents general attributes and each instance has one trajectory that is represented by the tablego_track_trackspoints.
- [Hurricanes and Typhoons](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/hurricane-database):he NHC publishes the tropical cyclone historical database in a format known as HURDAT, short for HURricane DATabas
- [Gowalla Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzpKyxX1dqTYRTFVYTd1UG81ZXc/view): This dataset was collected from Gowalla, a popular location-based social network, which has more than 600,000 users since November 2010 and was acquired by Facebook in December 2011. In practice, we used the Gowalla APIs to collect the user profiles, user friendship, location profiles, and users’ check-in history made before June 1, 2011. Finally, we have obtained 36,001,959 check-ins made by 319,063 users over 2,844,076 locations.
- [Weeplaces Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzpKyxX1dqTYYzRmUXRZMWloblU/view): This dataset is collected from Weeplaces, a website that aims to visualize users’ check-in activities in location-based social networks (LBSN). It is now integrated with the APIs of other location-based social networking services, e.g., Facebook Places, Foursquare, and Gowalla. Users can login Weeplaces using their LBSN accounts and connect with their friends in the same LBSN who have also used this application. All the crawled data is originally generated in Foursquare. This dataset contains 7,658,368 check-ins generated by 15,799 users over 971,309 locations. In the data collection, we can’t get the original Foursquare IDs of the Weeplaces users. We can only get their check-in history, their friends who also use Weeplaces, and other additional information about the locations.
