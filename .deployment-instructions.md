### Uploading a package to PyPI

The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a package to pypi: <https://dzone.com/articles/executable-package-pip-install>

#### Use Github Actions to deploy

1.  Create an API token to authenticate with PyPI:
     -  In your Pypi account settings, go to API tokens section and
 select "Add API token"

     -  Add the token to the Github Actions Secret.

2.  Create a github workflow with the following content:
```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  build-n-publish:
    if: github.event.base_ref == 'refs/heads/<branch-for-deploy>' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    name: Build and publish package
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.6
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.6
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        make dev
    - name: <optional step to lint and test the code>
      run: |
        make lint
        make test
    - name: Build
      run: |
        pip install setuptools wheel twine
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    - name: Publish
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master
      with:
        user: __token__
        password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }}
```

#### Configure bump2version

For the versioning control we a using the package bump2version.

1.  Run `pip install bump2version` in your environment
2.  Add the following attributes to the setup.cfg file:
```conf
[bumpversion]
current_version = <version_number>
allow_dirty = True
tag_name = version-{new_version}
tag = True
commit = True
[bumpversion:file:<path_to_file_version_file>]
[bumpversion:file:<path_to_setup_file>]
```

***Note:*** If `NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory`,
 check <https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version/issues/139> for a fix.

#### For more information see these links

-   <https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version>

---

1.  Run the command `bumperversion [major|minor|patch]` to increase the version number.
 This will create a new tag and commit the changes.

2.  Push the changes to the developer branch.

3.  Create a pull request onto master. To deploy pymove to Pypi using
 you must be in the master branch, pushing a tagged commit.

4.  After merging the new version into the master branch, push the new
 tag created by bump2version.
    -   `git push --tags`

## Conda-Forge Deployment

---

### Uploading a package to conda-forge

The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a
 package to conda-forge: <https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html>

---

#### Building conda recipe

With the package published to Pypi, we can easily deploy to the
 conda-forge chanel. First we create a conda recipe.

1.  Run the command conda `conda skeleton pypi <package_name>`.
 This will create a conda recipe for the package.

2.  Now add some information to the `<package_name>/meta.yaml` file.
```yaml
{% set name = <package_name> %}
{% set version = <package_version> %}

package:
  name: "{{ name|lower }}"
  version: "{{ version }}"

source:
  url: "https://pypi.io/packages/source/{{ name[0] }}/{{ name }}/{{ name }}-{{ version }}.tar.gz"
  sha256: <package_version_sha256>

build:
  number: 0
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"
  noarch: python

requirements:
  host:
    - pip
    - python >=3.6
  run:
    - <package_requirements>
    - python >=3.6

test:
  imports:
    - <all_possible_imports>

about:
  home: <repository_url>
  license: <licence>
  license_family: <licence_family>
  license_file: <path_to_licence_file>
  summary: <package_summary>
  doc_url: <package_docs_url>
  dev_url:

extra:
  recipe-maintainers:
    - <your_github_username>
    - <other_package_maintainers>
```

All package run requirements must be available in the conda-forge channel.

#### Request the publication to the conda-forge channel

1.  Fork the example recipes repository at <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes>

2.  Copy the `<package_name>/meta.yaml` file created in the step above to
 the forked repo `staged-recipes/recipes/example` directory

3.  Push the changes to your forked repository.

4.  Make a pull request for your repository to the master branch on
 the stage-recipes repository.
    -   `conda-forge:master from <your_github_username>:<package_name>`

5.  Now, the pull request will be checked.
    -   Comlete the checklist for the pull requests.

    -   The recipe meta.yaml file will be checked by the `conda-forge-linting service`.

    -   The recipe will be built for `linux64`, `macos64`
 and `windows64` systems.

6.  If there are any problems with the PR, a review team member will give
 you feedback, pointing out improvements and answering questions.

7.  Once everything is in order, the pull request will be aproved.

---

### Maintaining the feedstock repository

1.  After the pull request, a new repository for the package
 will be created similar to `https://github.com/conda-forge/<package_name>-feedstock.`

2.  You will be added as a maintainer for the newly created repository

3.  The repository will automatically build the conda package
 and upload to <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>

4.  To make any changes to the conda package, send a `PR` to the
 git feedstock repository main branch from a fork.

5.  Branches of the main repository are used for maintaining
 different versions only.

The `regro-cf-autotick-bot` will make an automatic `Pull Request`
 when it detects that the PyPi package has been updated.

Follow the `PR` instructions to update the `conda-forge` package.
