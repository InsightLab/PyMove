## Pypi Deployment

### Uploading a package to PyPI

The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a package to pypi: <https://dzone.com/articles/executable-package-pip-install.>

#### Get started with Travis CI

1.  Sing up on Travis-ci with GitHub.

2.  Accept the authorization of Travis CI.

3.  Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.

4.  Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.

#### Use the .travis.yml file to configure your deploy

1.  Create an API token to authenticate with PyPI:
    1.  In your Pypi account settings, go to API tokens section and select "Add API token"
    2.  Set your username to `__token__`

2.  Add the following attributes to the `.travis.yml` file:
```yaml
    language: python
    python: <package_version>
    script:
      - python setup.py sdist >/dev/null
      - python setup.py install
    deploy:
      skip_existing: true
      provider: pypi
      user: "__token__"
      password:
        secure: <password>
      on:
        tags: true
      on:
    branch:
      <branch_for_deployment>
```

3.  Go to the folder where your .travis.yml file is and run `travis encrypt your-api-token --add deploy.password` to encrypt your password and add it to the file.

#### Configure bump2version

For the versioning control we a using the package bump2version.

1.  Run `pip install bump2version` in your environment

2.  Add the following attributes to the .bumpversion.cfg file:
```yaml
    [bumpversion]
    current_version = <version_number>
    allow_dirty = True
    tag_name = version-{new_version}
    tag = True
    commit = True
    [bumpversion:file:<path_to_file_version_file>]
```

#### For more information on how to use and configure the deployment see these links

-   <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/>
-   <https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version>

### Deploy the package using Travis CI

1.  Run the command `bumperversion [major|minor|patch]` to increase the version number. This will create a new tag and commit the changes.

2.  Push the changes to the developer branch.

3.  Create a pull request onto master. To deploy pymove to Pypi using you must be in the master branch, Travis was configured to only allow deployments from tagged commits on the master branch.

4.  After merging the new version into the master branch, push the new tag created by bump2version.
    -   `git push --tags`

Travis CI will do the rest for you.

## Conda-Forge Deployment

---

### Uploading a package to conda-forge

The link in this tutorial will explain the steps to upload a package to conda-forge: <https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html>

---

#### Building conda recipe

With the package published to Pypi, we can easily deploy to the conda-forge chanel. First we create a conda recipe.

1.  Run the command conda `conda skeleton pypi <package_name>`. This will create a conda recipe for the package.

2.  Now add some information to the `<package_name>/meta.yaml` file.
```yaml
    {% set name = <package_name> %}
    {% set version = <package_version> %}

    package:
      name: "{{ name|lower }}"
      version: "{{ version }}"

    source:
      url: "https://pypi.io/packages/source/{{ name[0] }}/{{ name }}/{{ name }}-{{ version }}.tar.gz"
      sha256: <package_version_sha256>

    build:
      number: 0
      script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"
      noarch: python

    requirements:
      host:
        - pip
        - python >=3.6
      run:
        - <package_requirements>
        - python >=3.6

    test:
      imports:
        - <all_possible_imports>

    about:
      home: <repository_url>
      license: <licence>
      license_family: <licence_family>
      license_file: <path_to_licence_file>
      summary: <package_summary>
      doc_url: <package_docs_url>
      dev_url:

    extra:
      recipe-maintainers:
        - <your_github_username>
        - <other_package_maintainers>
```

3.  All package run requirements must be avaiable in the conda-forge channel.

#### Request the publication to the conda-forge channel

1.  Fork the example recipes repository at <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes>

2.  Copy the `<package_name>/meta.yaml` file created in the step above to the forked repo `staged-recipes/recipes/example` directory

3.  Push the changes to your forked repository.

4.  Make a pull request for your repository to the master branch on the stage-recipes repository.
    -   `conda-forge:master from <your_github_username>:<package_name>`

5.  Now, the pull request will be checked.
    -   Comlete the checklist for the pull requests.
    -   The recipe meta.yaml file will be checked by the `conda-forge-linting service`.
    -   The recipe will be built for `linux64`, `macos64` and `windows64` systems.

6.  If there are any problems with the PR, a review team member will give you feedback, pointing out improvements and answering questions.

7.  Once everything is in order, the pull request will be aproved.

### Maintaining the feedstock repository

1.  After the pull request, a new repository for the package will be created similar to `https://github.com/conda-forge/<package_name>-feedstock.`

2.  You will be added as a maintainer for the newly created repository

3.  The repository will automatically build the conda package and upload to <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>

4.  To make any changes to the conda package, send a `PR` to the git feedstock repository main branch from a fork.

5.  Branches of the main repository are used for maintaining different versions only.

The `regro-cf-autotick-bot` will make an automatic `Pull Request` when it detects that the PyPi package has been updated.

Follow the `PR` instructions to update the `conda-forge` package.
